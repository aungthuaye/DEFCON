Hello fellow devs. I'm just going to air my grievances here. Don't share this with mgmt LOL!! We'll get in so much trouble.

Anyway, I think management doesn't know what they're talking about. Can we agree here? I mean, we're ALL quite competent, but deliver a cutting-edge AI-based virus detection algorithm from scratch in 3 months!? Who APPROVED this? Why wasn't I ever consulted? And now we gotta deliver it. Hard deadline, folks. Yep. You know what, forget it. AI is just IF statements, right? Let's just give them what they want.

I am SO upset, I just want to mash my keyboard. Ok here it goes! asdfFD43EBz12-eefT459dbjkl; Phew! That felt a little better.
